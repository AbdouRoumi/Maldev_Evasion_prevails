# **MalDev: Detection Fails, Evasion Prevails**  
🚀 **Hosted at:** ESTIN Béjaïa  
🛡 **Organized by:** Nexus Security Club  

## 📌 Overview  
**Malware Development (MalDev)** focuses on understanding modern detection mechanisms and exploring evasion techniques. This session will provide a **hands-on approach** to bypassing **Antivirus (AV) & Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** solutions.  

## 🔧 Requirements  
To follow along, ensure you have:  

- **Windows OS** (for testing & analysis)  
- **Visual Studio** (for compiling the malware)  
- **C/C++ Development Tools**  
- **Process Explorer & Process Hacker** (for debugging & analysis)  
- **A safe test environment** (e.g., Virtual Machine, isolated system)  
- **Metasploit (msfvenom)** for generating shellcodes  

📌 **Important:**  
👉 You must **replace the provided shellcodes** with your **own generated shellcodes** before execution.  

## 📂 What’s in this session?  

### 🚀 **Malware Evasion Techniques**  
- ✅ **Empty Malware** – Testing basic detection on VirusTotal  
- ✅ **Simple Shellcode Execution** – Using `msfvenom` to generate payloads  
- ✅ **x86 Shellcode Execution** – Understanding architecture-specific payloads  
- ✅ **Code Signing** – Making malware appear legitimate  
- ✅ **XOR Shellcode Execution** – Encrypting payloads to evade signature-based detection  

### 🕵️ **Dynamic Analysis Evasion**  
- 🔍 **Anti-Debugging Techniques** – Detecting and preventing analysis  
- 🔍 **Detecting VirusTotal Sandbox Environments** – Identifying when running in a sandbox
