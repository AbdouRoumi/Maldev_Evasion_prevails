# Empty Malware Stub

## Overview
This is a minimal executable file that does nothing (`main` function simply returns). It is used as a baseline for testing how VirusTotal and other antivirus engines handle simple, harmless binaries.

## Purpose
- To test how VirusTotal flags an empty program.
- To compare detection rates against more complex samples.
- To establish a control sample before adding obfuscation or payloads.

## Code
```c
void main() {
    return;
}
```

## Expected Behavior
- This binary should not trigger any antivirus detections.
- Some heuristics-based engines may flag it based on compilation metadata.

## Usage
1. Compile the file:
   ```sh
   gcc -o empty.exe empty.c
   ```
   Or using Visual Studio:
   ```sh
   cl empty.c /Feempty.exe
   ```
2. Upload `empty.exe` to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and observe the results.

## Next Steps
- Gradually introduce minor changes (e.g., adding an unused variable).
- Test detection with simple system calls.
- Compare how different AV engines respond to obfuscation.
